App Description

This Streamlit application serves as an interactive educational guide to Extreme Bounds Analysis (EBA), a key sensitivity analysis technique in econometrics. The app provides a comprehensive theoretical overview, breaking down the complex methodologies of Edward Leamer and Xavier Sala-i-Martin through clear explanations, mathematical formulas, and interactive Plotly visualizations.

Key sections cover:

    The fundamental problem of model uncertainty.

    A detailed walkthrough of Leamer's strict extreme bounds test.

    An explanation of Sala-i-Martin's less restrictive, distribution-focused approach.

    A direct comparison of the two methods, highlighting their different criteria and outcomes.

    Illustrative examples of EBA's practical applications and its common critiques.
